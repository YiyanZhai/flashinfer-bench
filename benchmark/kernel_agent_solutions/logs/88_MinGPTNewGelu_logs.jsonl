This means we lack detailed insights into kernel performance characteristics like kernel launch configurations, memory bandwidth usage, or compute efficiency, which could highlight further optimization opportunities.\n\n5. **Correctness and Runtime:** The kernel passed correctness tests and exhibited consistent, though unprofiled, runtime performance on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090.

This is a good design pattern for reducing memory access latency when constant values are required.\n\n2. **Vectorized Operations:** The kernel employs vectorized operations by processing `float4` values, which is efficient as it can reduce the number of memory accesses by a factor of four for large contiguous blocks of data.\n\n3. **Leftover Handling:** However, the handling of leftovers in the data is not optimal. All leftover elements are processed by just one thread (the thread with `idx == 0`), which is not an efficient distribution of work across threads in the case where `leftover` is large. This can lead to bottlenecks and uneven workload distribution across threads.\n   ```cpp\n   if (idx == 0) {\n        for (int i = 0; i < leftover; i++) {\n            size_t offset = numel4 * 4 + i;\n            out[offset] = gelu_approx_scalar(x[offset]);\n        }\n    }\n   ```\n   Instead, the leftovers could be managed by a separate kernel or by distributing the leftover indices across more threads.\n\n4. **Performance Profiling Failure:** The tool report indicates that profiling with NVIDIA's Nsight Systems (nsys) failed due to a missing module (`nsys_helper`). This means we lack detailed insights into kernel performance characteristics like kernel launch configurations, memory bandwidth usage, or compute efficiency, which could highlight further optimization opportunities.\n\n5. **Correctness and Runtime:** The kernel passed correctness tests and exhibited consistent, though unprofiled, runtime performance on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090. The mean execution time is 0.0148 seconds with minor variance across 100 trials, suggesting stable kernel execution.\n\nGiven these points, while the kernel passes correctness tests and demonstrates good use of certain CUDA features, the lack of performance profiling data and the suboptimal leftover processing logic imply that further optimization is advisable before considering it fully optimized.\n\nPlease refine the kernel to address these issues."}], "model_output": "import math\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\nfrom torch.utils.cpp_extension import load_inline\n\n# We'll fuse the GELU operation into a single custom CUDA kernel\n# and store constants in device code for faster access.\n\nfused_gelu_source = r\"\"\"\n#include <torch/extension.h>\n#include <cuda_runtime.h>\n#include <math_constants.h>\n\n// Constants placed in constant memory\n__constant__ float c_sqrt;\n__constant__ float c_coeff;\n\n__global__ void fused_gelu_kernel(const float* __restrict__ x,\n                                  float* __restrict__ out,\n                                  const int size)\n{\n    int idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;\n    if (idx < size)\n    {\n        // read value from global memory\n        float val = x[idx];\n\n        // compute fused gelu\n        float cubic = val * val * val;\n        float inner = val + c_coeff * cubic;\n        float result = 0.5f * val * (1.0f + tanhf(c_sqrt * inner));\n\n        // store result\n        out[idx] = result;\n    }\n}\n\ntorch::Tensor fused_gelu_cuda(torch::Tensor x) {\n    // Ensure input is contiguous for coalesced global reads\n    x = x.contiguous();\n    auto size = x.numel();\n\n    // Prepare output tensor\n    auto out = torch::empty_like(x);\n\n    const int block_size = 256;\n    const int grid_size = (size + block_size -
